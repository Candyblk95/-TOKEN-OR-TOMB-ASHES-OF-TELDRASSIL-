**Live Rulebook:** https://candyblk95.github.io/-TOKEN-OR-TOMB-ASHES-OF-TELDRASSIL-/

---

## ✨ What’s the tea?
I’m a broke Night Elf Hunter in **Teldrassil** with a dream and a deadline.  
I’ve got **30 real days** to stack **380,000g**. If I win, I buy the Token and strut out like **Elune’s favorite sugar baby**.  
If I fail… I press **Delete Character → Accept**. *On camera.* 💀

## 🌿 Core Spice (aka the rules that hurt so good)
- **Zone-Locked, baby:** Teldrassil only. No Darkshore dalliances, no Stormwind splurges.
- **Knowledge is Power:** Recipes/patterns/mog appearances must be learned ASAP (or banked till I can). Duplicates or unusables can be sold later.
- **Vendor Trash Hustle:** At least one run of **GREYS ONLY**. Yes, squirrel tails are currency now.
- **Rags to Riches Rule:** I vendor my starting gear and begin in fantasy underwear. First real drop = first glow-up. 🩲✨

---

## 🐺 Hunter Drama (bring tissues)
- **Petship moods:** Pets must stay **Happy**. If they sulk → I pay: 5% gold or vendor a green.
- **Graveyard Stable:** If a pet dies, it’s stabled **forever**. Each tombstone eats a slot. Fill the stable? I lose Beast Mastery and respec—Elune says I’m a bad pet mom 😭
- **Bonding Ritual:** New pet? Buy a full stack of fave food and feed it all until they’re **Happy**. Only then is the bond sealed. 💋

---

## 🪽 Mobility, but make it earned
- **Mount Unlock:** Buy a fresh mount with Teldrassil gold… then **delete** it. Sacrifice accepted. Now I may ride.
- **Flying Lock:** **No flying before level 35.** To unlock, buy and delete *another* mount. Then we rise like a broke phoenix. 🔥

---

## 💀 Death Taxes (because pain = content)
- **My death:** I lose **10% of the gold in my pockets** to resurrect. Bank is safe (for now).
- **Pet death:** straight to the stable cemetery. No revives. No exceptions.

---

## ⏳ The Countdown
- **30 days**. That’s it.  
- Every episode updates the meter: *“Day 12: 7,230g… 372,770g to go 😭”*

---

## 💎 Endgame
- **Win:** Buy the Token, keep my hunter alive, and skip off with **30 days of game time** like Elune’s pampered sugar baby. 🌙💅  
- **Fail:** Delete the character **live**. No mercy.  
- **Optional Season 2:** If I fail but hit **170k+** (half the Token), I roll a tragic Night Elf heir in Darkshore with that inheritance. Soap-opera unlocked.
